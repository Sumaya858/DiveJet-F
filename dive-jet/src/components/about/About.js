        <p1> A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings
          of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
          this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
          friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect
          my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment.
          I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close
          to the earth. Thousand unknown plants are noticed by me. When I hear the buzz of the
          little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless. </p1>

          When I'm under water, it feels like home. it's like a parallel universe. When we freedive,
          every breath is a celebration of life. We dont fight what takes us under,
          we go with the flow. Lets go Deeper.
