        <p className='firstly'><strong>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings
          of spring<br></br> which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
          this spot, which <br></br> was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
          friend, so absorbed in the exquisite <br></br> sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect
          my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke <br></br> at the present moment.
          I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close<br></br>
          to the earth. Thousand unknown plants are noticed by me. When I hear the buzz of the
          little world <br></br>among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless.</strong> </p>
