            <p1> A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings 
          of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
           this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear 
           friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect
            my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment. 
            I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close
             to the earth. Thousand unknown plants are noticed by me. When I hear the buzz of the 
             little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless. </p1>
